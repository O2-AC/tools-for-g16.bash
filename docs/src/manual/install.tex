\section{Installation \& Configuration}
\label{sec:installation}

\subsection{Installation of the main scripts}

The scripts of this repository are not self-contained,
they each need access to the resources directory 
and it has to be called like that.

The easiest way to install the script is to clone the git repository from GitHub:\newline
\href{https://github.com/polyluxus/tools-for-g16.bash}{github.com/polyluxus/tools-for-g16.bash}.
Alternatively you can download the tarball archive of the latest release from there, too:\newline
\href{https://github.com/polyluxus/tools-for-g16.bash/releases/latest}{github.com/polyluxus/tools-for-g16.bash/releases/latest}.

After unpacking it only needs to be configured.
There are a two kinds of file names recognised:
\lstinline`g16.tools.rc` and the hidden \lstinline`.g16.toolsrc`.
The repository comes with an example of the former, 
therefore updating the repository will (probably) overwrite the file.
The latter file is excluded from this process,
and therefore has always precedence, 
so it is generally a safer option to configure.

The scripts will search for these configuration settings in the following order of directories:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the path to the script itself 
  \item the user's home directory
  \item the \texttt{.config} directory in the user's home directory
  \item the current working directory, i.e. from where the script is called.
\end{enumerate}
Only the last found file will be applied.

To make the scripts accessible from anywhere, the directory where they have been stored
must be found in the \texttt{PATH} variable.
Alternatively, you can create softlinks to them in a directory, 
which is already recognised by \texttt{PATH}.
A common setting for this is the local \texttt{\$HOME/bin}.

\subsection{The configuration scripts}

The repository comes with a configuration script in the \texttt{configure} directory.
It produces a formatted file like \lstinline`g16.tools.rc` from old or the default settings.
While you can assign an arbitrary filename, 
I recommend to store as \lstinline`.g16.toolsrc` in the root directory of the repository.

The script will prompt for options and will take user input where necessary.

Usage: 

\lstinline`configure.sh [opt]`

Options:

\begin{tabular}{p{0.1\linewidth}p{0.8\linewidth}}
  {\lstinline`-R`}       & Route mode. 
    Load the default configuration file and skip directly to the route section editor.
    This will replace the loaded configuration file.\\
  {\lstinline`-O`}       & Overwrite mode.
    Load a (specified) configuration file, run the configuration routine to update settings.
    This will replace the loaded configuration file.\\
  {\lstinline`-T`}       & Translate mode.
    Load the default cofiguration file (possibly from an earlier version), 
    and translate the settings to the most recent version and use default settings for everything unspecified.
    Depending on the configuration file loaded, this may or may not work well.
    This will replace the loaded default configuration file.\\
  {\lstinline`--`}       & Explicitly close reading script options. \\
  {\lstinline`-h`}       & Print a small help file. \\
\end{tabular}

The configure script will also, if desired, try to create softlinks to the scripts (omitting the \texttt{sh} suffix),
in the \texttt{\$HOME/bin} directory.

In the \texttt{configure} directory is a second script, \lstinline`routebuilder.sh`,
which is not designed to be executed on its own.
Instead it interfaces to the \lstinline`configure.sh` script to update the route sections within the configuration files.
However, it can be run by itself, creating an overwiew for the predefined routes and also manipulate them.
If no target file is specified, then they will be written to a temporary file.

Usage: 

\lstinline`routebuilder.sh [opt]`

Options:

\begin{tabular}{p{0.1\linewidth}p{0.8\linewidth}}
  {\lstinline`-r <ARG>`} & Raw mode. 
    Do not load the default configuration file, load \lstinline`<ARG>` instead as input.\\
  {\lstinline`-o <ARG>`} & Specify the output file for the created/ stored route sections.\\
  {\lstinline`-m <ARG>`} & Specify a custom message \lstinline`<ARG>` to include into the menu build.\\
  {\lstinline`--`}       & Explicitly close reading script options. \\
  {\lstinline`-h`}       & Print a small help file. \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Dependencies}

For displaying the help files, the command line utility \texttt{grep} is required.

Some scripts need access to an istallation of Open Babel;\footnote{%
  For more information see \href{http://openbabel.org/}{http://openbabel.org/}.}
it is mainly used to interface to the TurboMole \texttt{coord} file format,
and the post-processing scripts.

It should be no surprise that an installation of Gaussian 16 is necessary for
some of the scripts, currently used are the utilities \texttt{testrt} and \texttt{formchk}.
They can either be specified via paths to the respective binaries or directories,
or as modules which may be loaed at runtime via the \texttt{module} command.
A wrapper to set a suitable environment is included within this repository (see next chapter).
 % While a main wrapper (see next chapter) is still not included in the repository,
 % the scripts will accept these.
 % Otherwise the Gaussian environment has to be set up, 
 % and the utilities must be found in the \texttt{PATH} directories.
 % The direct path to these utilities might work, too.
 % 
 % The following example is a very simple wrapper script when using software modules. 
 % \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
 % #!/bin/bash
 % module load gaussian
 % "$@"
 % \end{lstlisting}

For the RWTH clusters, which have a modular environment installed, 
there is a separate repository with some more scripts, 
which can also interface to this repository.
