\section{Installation \& Configuration}

General settings for the scripts can be found in the file \texttt{g16.tools.rc}.
Alternatively, settings can be stored in \texttt{.g16.toolsrc}, 
which always has precedence.
Every script will check four different directories in the order
\begin{enumerate*}
\item installation directory,
\item user's home,
\item \texttt{.config} in user's home,
\item parent working directory.
\end{enumerate*}
It will load the last configuration file it finds.

Setting files can be generated with the \texttt{configure/configure.sh} script.
